    "The 1-sample t-test is a statistical procedure used to **determine whether a sample of observations could have been generated by a process with a specific mean**. The one sample t-test compares the mean of your sample data to a known value. For example, you might want to know how your sample mean compares to a known population mean. Here is a quick example of a scenario where a 1-sample t-test could be applied.\n",

To test this hypothesis, you could collect a sample of cakes from the production line, measure their weights, and compare the sample with a value of 2 using a one-sample t-test."

Paired tests are useful for determining how different a sample is affected by a certain treatment.
